# Feature engineering = process of creating features for the ML models to use for classification models

# NEEDS TO INCLUDE:
# *N-grams
# * TF-IDF
# *Bag of words approach - a way of extracting features from text for use in modelling, such as ML Algorthms
#   - It describes the occurence of words in a document

def tf_idf():
    'Utilises the TF-IDF Feature Engineering approach'
    print('Hello world')

def tf():
    'Utilises the term frequency (TF) - weighting method'
    print('Hello from the normal term frequency method')

def n_gram(n_value):
    'Allows the user to be able to input the n-value'

def FrequencyDistribution():
    '''Utilises nltk's frequency distribution function'''
    print("Hi from the FD Function")

def bagOfWords():
    '''Utilises SkLean's Count Vectoriser function to implement
    a "bag of words" method'''
    print('Debugging')
