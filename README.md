# WM3B7_PMA_Y3

## About The Project
This code aims to implement three suitable machine learning algorithms and optimise them using a combination of hyperparameters and suitable feature engineering features. Their performance will be measured using suitable machine learning performance metrics. The machine learning algorithms will be used to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMBD website. â€ƒ

## Built With:
* Anaconda Python Environment 'WM3B7'
* datetime
* os
* sklearn
* nltk
* pandas
* re
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* numpy
